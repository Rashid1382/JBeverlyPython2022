# JBeverlyPython2022

Here is the link to my Final project, Python for Data Analytics - Summer 2022
https://github.com/Rashid1382/JBeverlyPython2022   

About this file:
The purpose of the file is to explore the effect of different factors on test scores of 1000 male and female students from various ethnic groups,
  their parents level of education, whether or not they completed test prep courses.  We also looked at whether they received standard or free/reduced
  lunch and their math scores.  I hope to find some incites into the coorelations between the various factors and the math scores.

Here's a look at this Dataset:  
  This data set was compiled by a student from India.  The source of this data is based on student records compiled by the Indian government.  Similar studies have been conducted in the United States
  with similar factors that were used in this particular study.  I have a lot of friends and collegues from India and I wanted to know how the students in India
  stack up against their counterparts abroad. I am going to look at the following factors listed:
  
"gender" - male / female,   
"race/ethnicity" - one of 5 combinations of race/ethnicity groups,    
"parent education level" - highest education level of either parent,    
"lunch" - whether the student receives free/reduced or standard lunch,     
"test prep course" - whether the student took the test preparation course,     
"math" - exam score in math

When decidiing on how I was going to write this code to execute my analysis of the data set I have chosen I decided it would be easiest to:   
  1.) start by describing the data set, featuring its characteristics and parameters    
  2.) Utilize some built-in functions to show a small sample of the data frame such as 'shape' and display(dataframe.head()) or display(dataframe.tail())   
  3.) working on one section at a time, then combine them into several groups of code, each performing some function    
  
Graphs:   

Donut charts - I used this particular chart because it was an simple way to dipict the percentages of the various factors being studied.    
  easy visual on the entire set of data.    
histogram - For the 'math scores', to see the distribution of math scores without the associated categories.  
  It also easily compared the different race/ethnicity groups and test scores.    
a simple bar graph was selected to illustrate the comparison of the students who completed the test prep course and those who did not.    
  

# Findings
We can see that there are more female participants than male. Although the data is more or less balance we see the male count is less.
Comparing the data as depicted by the various graphs plotted its clear that:      

  Male are better at Maths in this set even though there number is lower.   
  Group E is comprised of up and coming intellects as their numbers were the highest scores overall.    
  Standard Lunch should be given to all as the performance is much better for the people who get lunch than free/reduced lunch.   
  Completing test prep courses is not playing a vital role as many are able to score good or at par with the course completed candidates.   
  The Data is left skewed mosly for C and E groups and normalized for the rest. It's overall a 60 + score, therefore the class performance is seen as awesome.     
  The Group we have has an higher average than the rest which makes it top of the class.

Free/Reduced top performers Analysis:     
The Top performers are mostly male compared to female but a student receiving 100 in math without standard food in Group E, is a blessing in itself.    
The Top performers are mostly Male in the groups but the Group E has 3 Females who got 100 in Math without even taking the test prep course. Brillant group.    

# Conclusions   
  There are more Female candidates than male candidates, yet the males did tend to do better    
  Most of the students have not completed the test prep course. With that said, I believe that the test prep courses    
    have not produced better results on helping students get better scores on tests.  Of course having a parent with some college seems to help as well   
  Be it any group, Standard lunch students performed better than Free/reduced lunch students.  Traditionally, males perform better than females in math and science,
  so this analysis does bare out that theory for the most part in general.  Eating a balanced meal regardless whether is was standard or free/reduced didn't bare out "why" 
  the two categories of meals were so different.  Although if we looked at whether the student had eaten regular meals as opposed to skipping the meals 
  I believe it may have shown a real coorelation on performance.  Overall the analysis was what I expected based on other sources of this study I've seen
  over the years.
